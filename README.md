This is my setup for hmd.me and my first try to git world :))
Included in this repo is what I change from /etc/nginx/ with directories as is
some suggestions will greatly appreciated 

In this configuration, I use debian 7, php5-fpm, nginx, and ngx_pagespeed
Easiest way to install ngx_pagespeed is add dotdeb repo and install 
nginx-extras packages which included ngx_pagespeed

Some Prequisities for using this config:
1. nginx-extras which provide ngx_pagespeed
2. php5-fpm
3. memcached

Prequisities vailable at dotdeb repo http://dotdeb.org
